          <h3>Caching</h3>
          <p>First: How web-surfing works. When accessing a webpage, your browser must send in a request for what to download and stuff. The server then decides what to send to your browser. Assuming that the requested content is okay to send, the server, the master computer that responds to HTTP requests, sends that content your way. To economize on subsequent requests, your browser will save some of the requested content so that it doesn't need to redownload resources each and every time you ping the server for something.</p>

          <p>Items that leverage flexbox require a container</p>
          <p>Initially, flex-direction is 'row' (i.e. the children of the flex-container will be laid out horizontally)

          <h5>wrap</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>wrap: wraps content if the page is too small to contain it </li>
            <li>wrap-reverse: wraps content while putting last element first</li>
            <li>no-wrap: compresses content</li>

          <h3>The Box Model</h3>
          <p>The box model describes the structure of every HTML element that's rendered. All elements are composed of four smaller rectangles: content, padding, border, and margin. Each of these is nested within the previous.</p>
          <p>Think: Shipping box.</p>
          <p>Center contains the content, the text or media.</p>
          <p>Around the content goes the padding, which is like the bubble wrap.</p>
          <p>Around the padding goes the border, which is like the box the content comes in.</p>
          <p>Margin goes around the element as the space around the box.</p>
          <p>Each layer of the box model can be configured via CSS.</p>
          <p>CSS properties can be applied to</p>
          <ul>
            <li>width</li>
            <li>height</li>
            <li>bg-color</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It's good practice to set the width and height for a given element so that no flexibility is left for the content to take up the space it needs.</p>
          <p>Padding does NOT obstruct the content at all.</p>
          <p>Padding is invisible.</p>
          <p>At least two rules are needed to make borders appear:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>width</li>
            <li>style</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Shorthand takes argument as</p>
          <ul>
            <li>width</li>
            <li>style</li>
            <li>color</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Background color does not extend into the margin area of a box.</p>
          <p>Declare margin via:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>margin-top</li>
              <li>margin-bottom</li>
              <li>margin-left</li>
              <li>margin-right</li>
            </ul>
            <p>margin shorthand:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>top, left-right, bottom</li>
              <li>top-bottom, left-right</li>
              <li>clock-style: top, right, bottom, left</li>
              <li>all-sides</li>
            </ul>
            <p>use box-sizing property to use alt-box model</p>
            <ul>
              <li>set: 'border-box'</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Otherwise, sizing will affect only the content box.</p>
            <p>border defaults</p>
            <ul>
              <li>width = 1px</li>
              <li>style = none</li>
              <li>color = same as content</li>

          <h4>Design mock-up</h4>
          <p>Mock-up image is an image created by a visual designer that indicates what they may want the web page to look like.</p>
          <p>The mock-up is passed to developers for them to implement.</p>
          <p>Match-up is rare.</p>
          <p>Evaluating mock-up:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Evaluate HTML</li>
            <li>Code HTML</li>

<!-- TODO: Convert to HTML
Two new media elements in HTML5:
- video
- audio
Attributes
- width,height: Self-explanatory, hopefully
- controls: Hide or show multimedia controls.
- poster: Allows user to use an image as a still when the video isn't playing.
- autoplay: Determines if the video is automatically played upon successful load.
- preload: auto,none,metadata.
- loop: Declare that the video will loop.
- muted: Declare that the video will play without sound.
Other elements
- source: Declare source-stack
- track: Assists with closed captioning
  - kind: Declare what the track element is being used for.
Grid
- A means of dividing horizontal and vertical space on a webpage into consistent units.
- Similar to dividing content via <table>
- Standard for print layouts.
Rules of the Grid
- All content goes within columns.
- Only columns may be immediate children of rows.
- Each row's column-count must be equal to either twelve or the grid's specified maximum. Declaring more columns will cause the columns to stack.
- Columns may contain rows, which contain more columns, which are known as "nested columns"
Look into: "clear-fix"
Open Source code
- Someone else does the coding
- Generally follows industry standards
- May not be maintained
- May be abstruse
- May not be compatible with your project.
CSS Grids
- are relatively new, but are foreseen to become a new standard.
- enables quick and easy layout of page elements.
- enables layout in consistently-spaced columns and rows.
- float and position attributes have no effect on elements within this layout.
Javascript can change a webpage by accessing the DOM
Learning the DOM will make learning Javascript easier to learn.
DOM = Document Object Model
Representation of a webpage that is computed by the browser
It can be interfaced with.
Browser computes the DOM from the HTML and JS that it receives for a page.
Represents HTML elements as nodes in a tree-like structure
Node != HTML element, but they can be thought of as such (ideally)
If you create a webpage via HTML only, then the DOM will be equivalent to the HTML
The browser dev-console shows what the DOM looks like
Why DOM and HTML may differ.
- There were errors in the HTML.
- Javascript may dynamically change the HTML.
- a server-side language may have changed the HTML
DOM
- a structured set of interfaces for programming languages to interact with it
- a set of specs made by the W3C that serve as guidelines for how browsers should behave.
- browsers provide a set of standard ways for programming languages to interact with the computed DOM
- each browser implements parts of that spec in whatever way it wishes, but ideally and most of the time in accordance with W3C standards.
Accessibility
- making website accessible to all users.
- about nineteen percent of Americans have trouble using the internet
- it is the duty of all web developers to make their sites accessible to this demographic
- visual: blind, low sight, color-blind
- audio: deaf, hard of hearing
- motor function impairments
- socioeconomic factors also
  - users who don't have access to internet at home
  - users who can access the internet only in public spaces and for limited periods of time
  - users who live in rural areas may be unable to browse normally
  - W3C has an article on accessibility
  - nvaccess.org: A screen reader application.
A11Y = Accessibility
Contrast ratio should be - 4.5:1
Use Web AIM to make sure color contrast between text and background is at least 4.5:1
Ease of clickability
- some users may have trouble clicking on small icons
- solution: provide padding and margin (works on inline items!)
To hide items:
- set position=relative,directional parameters to extreme values
- e.g. {position: relative: left: -10000px;}
- set an extra ruleset for that hidden item when that item gains focus via <Tab>
  - makes for quick and easy jumping.
  - idea: A navigational menu for <Tab>-users.
  - set {overflow:hidden;}, {height,width: (minuscule)}
Content only for screen-readers
- sr-only: A class introduced by Bootstrap to denote such content.
sr-only (CSS)
- position = absolute
- left = -10000px
- top = auto
- width, height = 1px
- overflow = hidden
sr-only (HTML)
- indicate if a link is opened in a new tab.
- this should precede a link that is opened in a new tab.
Tab users
- see attribute: "tabindex"
- note: Using this is almost always a bad idea; it makes navigation a pain
Zooming
- must ensure site works at 200% magnification
- text must either shrink or grow in accordance with screen size
Alt text
- One of the most important parts of making the Web accessible
- decorative elements want no alt-text (in fact, just use CSS imagery for this)
 background-image
 - useful to display part of an image differently
 - accepts either `href` or `src` attributes
 Other properties to style the background include:
 -image
 -color: Good practice to set this if the background doesn't load.
 -repeat
 -position
 -size
 Gradients
 - two varieties: linear and radial
 - Linear: Goes in a straight line; (linear-gradient)
 - Radial: originates from some center and spreads outwards
 linear-gradient
 - direction, start-color, end-color
 - direction, start-color, end-color, transition-percentage
 * direction: Can be angle or keyword
 radial-gradient
 - start-color, end-color
 - start-color, end-color, transition-percentage
 - gradient-shape, start-color, end-color, transition-percentage
 Responsive images
 - make images responsive when resizing viewport
 - use width property and media queries
 - use srcset/sizes attributes to load depending on viewport size
 Have image fill entire screen regardless of viewport size
 - width: 100%
 - height: auto
 - if the image is inside a container, the image will fill the container as the container is resized
 Have images behave differently at different sizes (don't want image to fill screen after width=600px)
 - @media (min-width: 600px) {width: 600px;}
 srcset/sizes properties
 - allows us to define multiple image sizes inside browser
 - use media queries to allow browser to decide which images to serve. ideal when we don't want phones to download too big of an image
 - https://via.placeholder.com/300
 <img>
 - srcset="src1 size1, src2 size2"
 - sizes="(condition1) size1-if-condition1, ..., [fallback]"
 Browser caches images, so steps must be taken before previewing a website whose image configurations have changed.
 - Head on over to the developer console.
 - Check the 'Disable cache'
 - Inspect 'Img' tab in the dev-console
Media queries
- essential part of responsive design
- JS conditionals for CSS
- allow developers to style based on viewport width, device orientation, and other media attributes
- @media screen and (max-width: [dimension]) {}
- @media print ...
- Omit elements by setting `display: none;`
- Most responsive design uses media queries to resize and hide elements
Media queries 2
Media types, features, and logical operators
- media query anatomy: '@media', media-type, media-feature (e.g. width)
- Combine media features with commas
Common breakpoints:
- extra-small devices: < 576px
- small devices: >= 576px
- medium devices: >= 768px
- large devices: >= 992px
- extra-large devices: >= 1200px
Responsive Web Design
Responsive web design importance and basics
Testing tools and methods for mobile responsiveness
Design strategies: graceful degradation vs. progressive enhancement
CSS techniques: percentages, REMs/EMs, media queries, Flexbox
Importance of the viewport meta tag for mobile devices
Viewport
The viewport is the area through which users interact with web content, varying significantly across devices.
Designing for a range of viewport sizes is essential for responsive web design, with common categories including mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop.
Developer tools in browsers, such as Chrome's DevTools, allow designers and developers to simulate different device sizes for testing purposes.
Extensions like Window Resizer offer quick adjustments to browser windows, emulating various device sizes for design and testing.
Debugging
Opening Chrome DevTools (Right-click > Inspect, Command+Alt+C on macOS, Control+Shift+C on Windows/Linux)
Navigating the Elements tab to inspect and edit HTML
Using the search function within DevTools (Command+F on macOS, Control+F on Windows/Linux)
Editing CSS directly in the browser
Adding new CSS properties
Disabling and deleting CSS properties
Editing an element's HTML (Right-click > Edit as HTML)
Moving HTML elements via click-and-drag
Saving changes made in DevTools back to the original HTML and CSS files
Forking and Cloning
Forking a GitHub repository
Cloning a repository to the local machine
Adding a git remote connection (upstream)
Checking remote connections with git remote -v
Creating and switching to new branches with git checkout
Adding, committing, and pushing changes to GitHub
Opening and merging pull requests
Updating local branches with changes from GitHub (pulling from origin and optionally upstream)
Pull Requests
Forking and cloning repositories
Making changes and saving them in a text editor
Using git commands in the terminal: git clone, git add ., git status, git commit -m, and git push
Creating pull requests on GitHub
Understanding the role of pull requests in project collaboration
All sites are designed for a variety of screen sizes
Designing for so many screens is now standard practice
Responsive design matters because:
- users will be frustrated with phone layout.
- page may take too long to load
DevTools, own phone, other simulators give dev a good idea of how their scren will look
Websites are made responsive by conditioning on screen-size and switching code-bases as necessary
Design theories for RWD
- graceful degradation
- progressive enhancement: design for mobile first (i.e. mobile first)
While designing CSS:
- Percentages for widths
- REMS/EMS for font-sizing
- media queries
- flexbox
- link size appropriate for touch
70 to 80 characters
Add breakpoints every 10 words
Viewport
- controls width and scaling
- width = device-width
- initial-scale = 1
- don't disable user scaling
I must remember to put this tag in.
<meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1' >
The Viewport
What is a viewport?
A rectangular area where you can see computer graphics
Content outside viewport is invisible until scrolled into view
Most of the time it's just the browser
Common viewport sizes
mobile=320-480, tablet=768=1024, laptop=1024+, desktop=
Bootstrap (CSS Framework) has its own breakpoints
small: 576
medium: 768
large: 992
extra-large: 1200
Let project define specs
Recreate viewport sizes via dev-tools
DevTools is a very useful tool for developers.
One can add elements, delete elements, edit elements, and so on.
Any changes made to the browser version of a document are not reflected in the source
Procedure for forking and cloning
Get started
1. Fork repo to GH space
2. clone repo to PC
3. Add git remote connection back to 'upstream'
Workflow
1. Create new branch off master for each assignment
2. Push work on branch to fork
3. Open pull request from assignment branch to master branch of fork
4. After assignment is graded, merge pull request.
git remote -v
- list remote branches
git remote add [alias] [location-of-repo]
git push [alias] [branch-name]
- presumably push contents of [branch-name] to [alias] connection
git pull [alias] [branch-name]
- download contents of remote-alias to branch
Pull Requests
- a means whereby changes can be commmitted back to the original repo
- allow code to be reviewed, commented on, then merged in.
User personas
constitute UX design
help designers and developers
represent person using a site
include attributes like image, age, work, hobbies, etc.
multiple personas may be generated
User persona for:
prospective and incoming freshmen
assume ~18 yo
include field for other details
e.g. prospective degrees and minor details
Browser support
Use info from user persona in order to determine which browsers to support
focus support on most popular browsers for desktop and mobile
Focus on supporting (chrome, firefox, safari, android!chrome)
May want to pay attention to other browsers, like phone browsers
Must ensure mobile responsivity
Support fringe browsers as time allows: e.g. safari, ie, edge, opera
How to know for sure?
Do user research for new websites.
Use analytics for existing websites
Research will help you determine what to develop for
Tools for testing sites:
- browser support: desktop (chrome, safari, edge)
- mobile (safari, android!chrome)
- comon to support two most recent versions of browsers
Responsiveness
- site must work on as many devices and widths as possible
- manipulate content with media queries
- size defined in percentages and relative unites
Design Considerations
- graceful degradation
- progressive enhancement (perferered)
general rules
- text, controls and images are aligned properly
- hover and selection states highlight and color changes
- suitable click area
- color and shading and gradient are consistent
- correct padding around edges.
- text, images, controls and the like do not run into edges of screen
- font size, style and color are consistent for each type of text
- type, text, data and choice scroll and display properly
- pages readable on all resolutions
- horizontal bar is not visualized
- content defined as important should be visual in all breakpoints
- breakpoints match our design
- option to alter layout for different breakpoints
Tools to check sites
- HTML5 validator
- viewing site in browsers
- devtools in major browsers
- emulators
- the actual devices if available
*TEST IN ALL MAJOR BROWSERS!*
Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
Most common way to test: resize window
Limitations
- hard to know precise dimenionns
- hard to test interactions
Sequence
- common to develop for chrome first
- develop for other browsers based on intel gathered
Browser extensions
- can be helpful to autoresize window
- use discretion about adding extensions
Testing responsiveness
- browser devtools
- chrome: DevTools
Chrome: DevTools
- toggle phone icon to change viewport width
Emulators offer more precision when testing
- e.g. XCODE allows one to emulate Apple devices
Testing on actual devices
- test on live site via phone
- build private staging area
- build local server on laptops
- requires python or node
- beware of security risks

<!--
  Javascript is often abbreviated as `ESx` in reference to its versions
  Serves primarily in front-end dev-work and increasingly on server-side (i.e. back-end)
  Websites are like houses.
  - HTML: provides structure
  - CSS: provides decoration
  - JS: makes everything run
  Javascript
  - cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language
  - used to make web-pages interactive
  - more advanced server-side variants exist (e.g. nodejs) 
  All major browsers support ES5
  Use JS via:
  
  - browser dev-console
  - node
  - online code sandboxes
  CodePen is an online web-dev environment
  Data Types
  - JS allows user to create variables without declaring their types
  - primitives include: boolean, null, number, string, symbol
  - null: reference to invalid or nonexistent object or address
  - undefined: no defined value
  - symbols: allows for unique identifier; relatively new
  Variables 1
  - abstain from using `var`
  - names should be semantic wrt purpose of variable
  console.log
  - prints value of some variable
  clear
  - clear console
  strings are best declared via single quotation marks
  strings can be concatenated via plus-sign
  Variables 2
  - strings can contain anything, even numbers
  - sum of numeric string and number is sum of numeric string and number after conversion to string
  - product of numeric string and number is product of numeric string converted to number and that number
  - =: assigns values to variables
  - ==: tests for equality of values
  - ===: tests for equality of values and types
https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1779530/pages/lesson-03c-flow-control-and-loops-3?module_item_id=23014897
  Control Flow
  - to control the flow of a program based on conditions
  - not advised to use more than two to three if-else statements
  - if more than that many are needed, use a switch statement
  Loops
  - for repeating the same task over again
  - for (counter; check counter; modify counter)
  - condition is checked at beginning of when an iteration would be run
  - do-while useful for login prompts

  Web Forms
  basic example: label, input, submit-button
  action="place to send data to"
  place handles sent data and does stuff with it
  HTTP
  HyperText Transfer Protocol
  Set of rules that govern how data is commuicated across the WWW
  messages sent on internet are called 'requests' and 'responses'
  Forms send either GET or POST requests (for info)
  method={POST,GET,...}
  Search forms usually send GET 
  POST requests are meant to send data that alters data on the server side
  Build forms with neither action nor method attributes
  Handling forms via JS will be covered elsewhere
  default upon submit: Page refreshes, form values appended to URL
  choice of method relates to security

  HTML Web Forms
  doctype
  html tag
  head
  meta-char encoding
  title
  body
  input
  - name: how the data will be labelled when handled on server-side
  label
  - can wrap about the input field
  - for: must match the `id` of the input-field to which it is related
  button or input-submit

  Styling Forms
  accessibility and functionality are of utmost priority
  be aware of browser compatibility issues
  font-family: inherit
  font-size 100%
  box-sizing: border-box
  some inputs are inline, some are block
  width: 100%
  styles can be added also with pseudoclass selectors
  valid, invalid, enabled, disabled, checked, required, optional, focus
  a form element is focussed upon click or <Tab>
  outline: none
  border-radius: (dimension of length)
  > to make things less cornered
  add line breaks and spacing for aesthetics
  transform into block elements via display property
  button, input, select, textarea {
    font-family: inehrit; font-size: 100%; box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  add margin for spacing
