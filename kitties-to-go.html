  Instructions
      In the kitty course project, add a background image, using the background-image CSS property. Ensure that the photo looks appropriate on all viewport sizes. 
      Ensure that all the other elements on the page display appropriately as the image changes. 
      Add a gradient to the page. You won't be to see this unless you disable the background-image property. This is helpful in case the image doesn't load.
      Make sure that all images on the site are appropriately sized.
  When complete submit the link to your repo and live page. 
  By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
      Use "srcset" attribute on an image element to serve appropriately sized images for user's device
      Use CSS to apply images and gradients to HTML elements
      Explain the impact of images on website performance
      Identify different strategies to make images responsive

Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then <a href="./index.html">retire to the warmest spot</a> on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what’s your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently cough and swat at dog
        </p>
        <p>
