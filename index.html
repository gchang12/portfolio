  <!-- Assignment 02: Prompt
  4. In this portfolio directory, create a simple, two page site. The pages should link to each other in the main navigation. One of the pages should be a list of projects that you have done (or that you might do- it's ok to dream right now!). With each project include a title, small image, and link to location of project. Be sure to include the Lesson 01 assignment! I know you might not have a lot of projects to link to right now- just use dummy data and links that go to “#” to flesh it out as necessary. The second page can be whatever you like, though "About Me" is a nice default. Whichever you would like to be the landing page for the site should be named index.html.
  5. Use dummy content wherever you like on these pages (feel free to use Lorem Ipsum https://lipsum.com/
  6. Links to an external site.). We'll be revisiting this project over the next several weeks, and you can add more content as we go. The focus should be on writing clean, semantic HTML. We will add CSS to this site starting next week. Please do not do any styling this week.
  7. There are no length requirements on these pages, but I expect each to have header, article, and footer sections, with relevant, semantic content within each. File names should be "kebab style" (lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces) and internal links should be correct. As always, style matters. If you are including local images, they should be inside a directory called "images" within the main project directory.
  8. Remember to view your pages in different browsers before turning this in. If you've made HTML errors that reduce the functionality of the page, you'll lose points, and they're easy to catch by just viewing it in a browser! You should also remember to always validate your code: https://validator.w3.org/
  Links to an external site..
  Use git to commit as you go along. Create a GitHub repository called 'portfolio' and link it to your local repository. Push your work up to GitHub, and submit a link to the GitHub repo for the assignment. Refer to Lessons 00 and 01 if you need a refresher on git & GitHub.

    Caching. First: How web-surfing works. When accessing a webpage, your browser must send in a request for what to download and stuff. The server then decides what to send to your browser. Assuming that the requested content is okay to send, the server, the master computer that responds to HTTP requests, sends that content your way. To economize on subsequent requests, your browser will save some of the requested content so that it doesn't need to redownload resources each and every time you ping the server for something.
